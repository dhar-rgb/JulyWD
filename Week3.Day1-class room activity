Classroom Assignment <3A>: Demonstrating Abstraction in Java
Learning Objective
To understand and implement the concept of Abstraction in Java by creating interface, an abstract class and a concrete 
class with the context of online payments 
Expected Completion Time:
Best Case: 20 minutes
Average Case: 30 minutes
Assignment Details:
Design an abstract class that implements an interface with abstract methods representing various payment methods and 
further implement those methods in a concrete class.
Requirements:
Create an Interface Payments with the following abstract methods:
 - cashOnDelivery()
 - upiPayments()
 - cardPayments()
 - internetBanking()
Create an Abstract Class CanaraBank that implements Payments interface and adds `recordPaymentDetails()` for 
payment specifics.
Create a Concrete Class Amazon that inherits CanaraBank, implementing methods.
Hints to Solve:
- Utilize appropriate keywords to signify that a class is implementing an interface.
- Implement abstract methods in the concrete class to provide specific functionality
Reference Links:
Abstraction in Java - Oracle Docs
Expected Outcome:
Upon completion, you should be able to:
- Grasp the concept of Abstraction in Java, including interface and concrete class.
- Created a practical example of how abstraction allows for the definition of a common structure while leaving 
specific implementations to subclass.

// Create an implement class Payment.java
package Week3.Day1;

public interface Payments {
	public void cashOnDelivery();
	public void upiPayments();
	public void cardPayments();
	public void internetBanking();



}



/// Create an abstract class (CanaraBank.java)

package Week3.Day1;

import day2.Payments;

public abstract class CanaraBank implements Payments {
	//public abstract void recordPaymentDetails()`;
	
public void recordPaymentDetails(){
System.out.println("deposited 2000INR`");
}

}


// open a new concrete class that uses and implements the implement class 
//(Payments.java) and abstract method (CanaraBank.java)

public class Amazon extends CanaraBank {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Amazon transaction = new Amazon();
		
		transaction.cardPayments();
		transaction.cashOnDelivery();
		transaction.upiPayments();
		transaction.cardPayments();
		transaction.internetBanking();
		transaction.recordPaymentDetails();
	}

	@Override
	public void cashOnDelivery() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("dispersed cash of 1000");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void upiPayments() {
		System.out.println("upi payments was added to the account");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void cardPayments() {
		System.out.println("made month card payment of 100INR");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void internetBanking() {
		System.out.println("purchased an item from amazon");
		
	}

}
